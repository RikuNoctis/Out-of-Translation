I've spent a great amount of time dedicated to perfecting this skeleton for easy end-user modification.<br/>

It'd be a shame to not publicly share translation tools and documents. :(
<br/><br/>
If you have a question or need help with this project skeleton, feel free to create an issue here.<br/>
Otherwise if you have a question regarding [Out-of-Py](#out-of-py), please create a separate issue in its [respective repository](#out-of-py-repo).
